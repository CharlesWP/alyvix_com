## Nerdio, Adar Inc

#### Sector: IT


### Managing the Cloud:  End-to-End Monitoring with Alyvix

Founded in 2005, Nerdio is a US technology pioneer offering its customers cloud
IT services through the Nerdio solution – Windows desktops used via the
Internet.  Only when the user experience with the cloud is comparable to that of
a traditional PC can this business concept achieve the expected success.  Thus
measuring these performance metrics is critical, leading Adar to decide to
introduce the Alyvix end-to-end monitoring solution.


### The Challenge

Monitoring the real user’s perception of delivered services is a fundamental
need to guarantee Adar's corporate objectives.


### The Solution

Nerdio needed to measure latencies and end-to-end client performance from the
user’s perspective.  Würth Phoenix's Alyvix helps them simulate user operations
in applications such as Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer, helping to
quickly identify any performance problems.


### Result

Alyvix finds performance slowdowns, helping Nerdio staff fix them even before
their users can notice anything is happening.  It also helps Nerdio achieve
guaranteed service levels, with demonstrable data that can be visualized
graphically by customers.

“Using traditional monitoring systems, it's practically impossible to check the 
perceptions that real user have of system performance.  With Alyvix instead, we
succeeded in obtaining significant data for helping assess the satisfaction of
our customers.  Thanks to the simulation of user interactions with our systems,
we can guarantee high levels of service for our desktop-centric solution.”
