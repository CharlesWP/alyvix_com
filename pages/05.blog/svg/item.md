"You can only be sure that the service is running by clicking through it."

The Südtiroler Gemeindenverband needed a new way to check their intranet
was continuously responsive.  Würth Phoenix helped them configure Alyvix
to verify responsiveness and display the results over time in a way that
anyone in the organization could easily track.

### Sector: Public Administration

### Employees: 70



### The Challenge

Classic monitoring can show you whether or not single IT components like a
server, a hard disk or a CPU are functioning in isolation.  But it doesn't
verify that your critical applications as a whole are actually running.
Südtiroler Gemeindenverband needed a way to monitor that the integration of
components were delivering services, not just functioning individually.


### The Solution

Würth Phoenix helped SGV define typical transaction sequences that were
run automatically by Alyvix.  The results are then displayed graphically on a
dedicated website which is accessible to all stakeholders in their organization.
This includes IT employees and nursing personnel who can inform themselves
about application availability and performance at any moment in real time.


## Why SGV's IT Applications Are Crucial 

Whether an application is truly working or not can only be verified by actually
using it.  SGV (Südtiroler Gemeindenverband), the association of municipalities
of South Tyrol that operates a data center with 40 IT employees for all
South Tyrolean municipalities and district communities, established a continuous
and automated application monitoring approach.  

To provide optimal working conditions, SGV needed to ensure that all of its
members could reliably access all applications under their responsibility at
any time of the day or the night, seven days a week.  Especially critical are
those applications relating to retirement homes, where important information
about residents is held.

It is crucial that their nursing personnel get vital information such as who
must take which medicine, how much, and when.  They also must know if a
medicine has already been administered that day, along with residents’ medical
histories.  Applications like these clearly play a key role and must be
available 24×7.


## From Idea to Reality: Alyvix Replaces Manual Verification

Despite these business-critical characteristics, system failures continued to
occur.  Unfortunately, these downtimes often went unnoticed by IT employees
until they were reported by the staff in the retirement homes themselves.  Thus
it became necessary to constantly inform them about application status, greatly
reducing their productivity.

However, the idea of a 24×7 on-call service was excluded from the beginning.
As Stefan Kofler, system administrator at SGV, explains: “Our wishful thinking
consisted of creating a procedure that would start the application, log on, and
enter data.  This was the only way to quickly and reliably ensure that all the
interactions among databases, the application server, and its processes were
working properly.  Through our ordinary monitoring checks it was only possible
to confirm that the preconditions were there for smooth operation, but you can
only be sure that a given service is running by actually clicking through it.”

At the South Tyrol Free Software Conference (SFScon), SGV saw Alyvix for the
first time and decided to implement this open source solution.  Because of
human resource constraints, Würth Phoenix was engaged to conduct both the
implementation and staff training.  After a day and a half, the system was
up and running, and SGV's IT employees were able to independently build the
necessary test cases.

The result is a continuous simulation of typical interaction sequences, and
the subsequent output of the check results in graphical form on a dedicated
website.  Now staff is informed about current application at all times,
without any human intervention.


## Conclusion: An Optimal Complement to Classic Monitoring

Stefan Kofler, head System Administrator at the association of municipalities,
summarizes the benefits:

“Alyvix is a very good complement to classic monitoring.  Despite having a
monitoring system, prior to the implementation of Alyvix we didn't know if
everything was really running.  The reasons are obvious:  A firewall or a
virus scanner on the application server could block a service, or the
interplay between application server and database could be problematic even
though individually all components were running fine.  The classic monitoring
approach does not take this aspect into consideration.  We never knew for
certain if everything was really working together.  Today things look quite
different:  Thanks to continuous Alyvix tests, we are constantly kept up to
date about the availability and performance of all our applications.”

The association of municipalities, SGV, is responsible for consulting,
assisting and promoting all South Tyrolean municipalities and district
communities.  In this context, the association executes various activities
including the creation and operation of common data processing and IT systems.
Similarly, the development and maintenance of hardware and software are part
of its essential tasks.
