## On premises or **Cloud**

Alyvix supports two solution methods, where Alyvix and a monitoring system are deployed within your existing infrastructure, or where we manage everything for you within the Cloud.

* **On Premises:** A monitoring system and Alyvix Service run on your infrastructure, and you build your own test cases
* **In the Cloud:** Both Alyvix and a monitoring system are installed on your monitoring provider's cloud infrastructure, and we build and maintain your test cases
